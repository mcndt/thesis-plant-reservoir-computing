% Introduction to application domains.
Reservoir computing has enjoyed success in a multitude of research domains because of its simple computational model, the potential for real-time processing, and broad applicability to problems in the physical world \citep{tanaka_recent_2019}. 
Early applications of RC include time series prediction tasks such as stock price forecasting and weather forecasting \citep{nakajima_physical_2020}. 
Table \ref{table:rc-subjects} shows a comprehensive summary of the domains to which RC has been applied as compiled by \citet{tanaka_recent_2019}.
Similarly, \mbox{Table \ref{table:rc-applications-benchmarks}} gives a selection of works that demonstrate the application of reservoir computing.

% Tables \ref{table:rc-subjects} and \ref{table:rc-applications-benchmarks} give an overview of subjects to which RC has been applied and references to applications and benchmarks respectively.
% In robotics, RC is deployed as a low-power real-time integrator of sensor data and motor controller  \citep{nakajima_information_2015, burms_reward-modulated_2015}.

% One of the earliest demonstrations of reservoir computing is the Liquid State Machine (2002)\citep{maass_real-time_2002}.

% Since its inception, reservoir computing has been successfully applied in several domains. % though today it has mostly been succeeded by Deep Learning techniques \cite{citation needed}.

% - Example of LSM \cite{maass_real-time_2002}

% - Examples of applications are \cite{lukosevicius_reservoir_2012, nakajima_physical_2020}. see also Tanaka 2019 section 2.2 table 1 and table 2 \cite{tanaka_recent_2019}.

% - Also the source of more theoretical research in mathematics and chaos, see \cite{hermans_recurrent_2012, gauthier_next_2021}
