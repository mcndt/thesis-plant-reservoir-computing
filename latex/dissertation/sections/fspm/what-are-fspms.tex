% What are \acrshort{fspm}s?
A promising category of models that can the stated criteria is that of functional-structural plant models (\acrshort{fspm}) \citep{godin_functionalstructural_2005, louarn_two_2020}.
\acrshort{fspm} model the plant as a collection of interconnected units that represent a small structural part of the plant in space.
These units interact with the environment and with each other to simulate eco-physiological processes \citep{coussement_turgor-driven_2020}. 
The structural elements of the simulated plant form a hierarchy of interactions at different scales. Together they govern the macroscopic behavior of the organism \citep{louarn_two_2020}. Most \acrshort{fspm}s simulate interactions across a range of scales, from cell organelles to whole plant organs and even populations of multiple organisms. A schematic representation of the different scales of interactions is shown on Figure \ref{fig:fspm_scales_louarn2020}.

% What are \acrshort{fspm}s for?
Functional-structural plant models owe their success to more than two decades of interdisciplinary collaboration between biology, biophysics, ecology, and computer science \citep{louarn_two_2020}.
At present, \acrshort{fspm}s have been applied in developmental biology \citep{cieslak_integrating_2016, schneider_light_2019, gauthier_functional_2020}, integrative and systems biology \citep{zhu_plants_2016, chang_systems_2019, millar_practical_2019} and applied plant sciences \citep{renton_modelling_2017, albasha_hydroshoot_2019, university_of_reading_uk_advances_2021}. 
The accelerated development in this area of research is enabled by common frameworks that standardize the description of e.g.\ plant architecture \citep{godin_multiscale_1998, boudon_l-py_2012} and eco-physiological interactions \citep{fournier_caribu_2016, zhou_cplantbox_2020}. 
Popular platforms for functional plant modelling workflows are OpenAlea \citep{pradal_openalea_2008, pradal_openalea_2015}, GroIMP \citep{vos_groimp_2007} and GreenLab \citep{de_reffye_two_2021}. 


% What do \acrshort{fspm}s model?
The precise set of simulated physiological processes varies from model to model. 
Commonly modeled factors include hydraulic pressure, water and carbon flow, and photosynthesis \citep{coussement_turgor-driven_2020, zhou_cplantbox_2020, albasha_hydroshoot_2019}. 
The complexity of the environmental simulation also differs between models, ranging from manual application of input values in root nodes \citep{zhou_cplantbox_2020} to ray-traced application of lighting conditions, including self-shading \citep{coussement_turgor-driven_2020}.
Further still, some \acrshort{fspm}s model plant growth over the span of an entire growth season \citep{lecarpentier_walter_2019, coussement_turgor-driven_2020} where others assume a static plant geometry with predefined limits for simulation duration and model accuracy \citep{albasha_hydroshoot_2019}.


% Some examples
\mbox{Figure \ref{fig:plant_model_examples}} highlights a small selection of models from the literature.
% Soybean FSPM
First, Soybean FSPM \citep{coussement_turgor-driven_2020} is a highly detailed mechanistic plant growth model. 
Soybean FSPM was developed to understand better a plant's macroscopic behavior in relation to water.
The model simulates vegetative growth driven by hydrostatic pressure inside the plant cells and incorporates a ray-traced lighting model with dynamic lighting and shading conditions \mbox{(Figure \ref{fig:fspm-soybean-fspm})}. 
% V-Mango
V-Mango \citep{boudon_v-mango_2020} models the vegatative and reproductive development of mango trees to enable \textit{in silico} experimentation with better cultivation practices.
The model allows researchers to understand why certain characteristics of mango trees make them more susceptible to pests and to study the influence of the three-dimensional tree architecture on fruit growth.
% Other models.
While this is far from an exhaustive list of what has been accomplished with FSPMs, it should give the reader an idea of what is possible with this first-principles approach to plant modeling.

% Caution before reusing an FSPM from the literature
An important caveat is that these models typically do not simulate a live plant as an accurate digital twin of an \textit{in vivo} plant.
Instead, they are commonly developed with a specific research question in mind and model only the physiological processes that are deemed correlated to the studied phenomenon \citep{louarn_two_2020}.
Hence, it is warranted to perform a careful comparison between the conditions and assumptions of the original study and those of a new context before reusing the model for tasks other than its original purpose.
Note that digital twin initiatives are also an active line of research. For example, researchers at WUR have been developing a digital twin system for tomato plants \citep{npec_wur_2020}.
