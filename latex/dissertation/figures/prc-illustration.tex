	        {Illustration of different reservoir computing implementations, both theoretical and physical versions. 
	        Each of the subfigures depicts a different type of implementation: 
	            (a) RNN-based version; 
	            (b) soft body built of silicone \citep{nakajima_information_2015}; 
	            (c) compliant robot made of a tensegrity structure \citep{caluwaerts_locomotion_2013}; 
	            and (d) plant as reservoir.
