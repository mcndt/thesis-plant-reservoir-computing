\section{Summary}

This chapter introduced the research field of functional-structural plant modeling, a type of model that has become the state-of-the-art in plant modeling in the past years.
FSPMs represent the plant as a 3D structure of interconnected elements, where each structural element simulates eco-physiological processes such as photosynthesis, transpiration, and water and carbon flow.
FSPMs are ideal for reservoir computing research because they model the interaction in space and time between the plant's structure and the abiotic environment.
Therefore, if plant physiology displays properties of nonlinear dynamical systems, this will be captured by a sufficiently detailed FSPM.
