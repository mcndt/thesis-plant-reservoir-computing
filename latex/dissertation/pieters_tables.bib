  abstract = {This paper describes a new approach to the calibration of thermal infrared measurements of leaf temperature for the estimation of stomatal conductance and illustrates its application to thermal imaging of plant leaves. The approach is based on a simple reformulation of the leaf energy balance equation that makes use of temperature measurements on reference surfaces of known conductance to water vapour. The use of reference surfaces is an alternative to the accurate measurement of all components of the leaf energy balance and is of potentially wide application in studies of stomatal behaviour. The resolution of the technique when applied to thermal images is evaluated and some results of using the approach in the laboratory for the study of stomatal behaviour in leaves of Phaseolus vulgaris L. are presented. Conductances calculated from infrared measurements were well correlated with estimates obtained using a diffusion porometer.},

  abstract = {The persistence and productivity of forage grasses, important sources for feed production, are threatened by climate change-induced drought. Breeding programs are in search of new drought tolerant forage grass varieties, but those programs still rely on time-consuming and less consistent visual scoring by breeders. In this study, we evaluate whether Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based remote sensing can complement or replace this visual breeder score. A field experiment was set up to test the drought tolerance of genotypes from three common forage types of two different species: Festuca arundinacea, diploid Lolium perenne and tetraploid Lolium perenne. Drought stress was imposed by using mobile rainout shelters. UAV flights with RGB and thermal sensors were conducted at five time points during the experiment. Visual-based indices from different colour spaces were selected that were closely correlated to the breeder score. Furthermore, several indices, in particular H and NDLab, from the HSV (Hue Saturation Value) and CIELab (Commission Internationale de l\&rsquo;\&eacute;clairage) colour space, respectively, displayed a broad-sense heritability that was as high or higher than the visual breeder score, making these indices highly suited for high-throughput field phenotyping applications that can complement or even replace the breeder score. The thermal-based Crop Water Stress Index CWSI provided complementary information to visual-based indices, enabling the analysis of differences in ecophysiological mechanisms for coping with reduced water availability between species and ploidy levels. All species/types displayed variation in drought stress tolerance, which confirms that there is sufficient variation for selection within these groups of grasses. Our results confirmed the better drought tolerance potential of Festuca arundinacea, but also showed which Lolium perenne genotypes are more tolerant.},

  abstract = {Modern highly insulated greenhouses are more energy efficient than conventional types. Furthermore applying dynamic greenhouse climate control regimes will increase energy efficiency relatively more in modern structures. However, this combination may result in higher air and crop temperatures. Too high temperature affects the plant photosynthetic responses, resulting in a lower rate of photosynthesis. To predict and analyse physiological responses as stress indicators, two independent experiments were conducted, to detect the effect of high temperature on photosynthesis: analysing photosystem II (PSII) and stomatal conductance (gs). A combination of chlorophyll a fluorescence, gas exchange measurements and infrared thermography was applied using Chrysanthemum (Dendranthema grandiflora Tzvelev) ‘Coral Charm’ as a model species. Increasing temperature had a highly significant effect on PSII when the temperature exceeded 38~°C for a period of 7 (±1.8) days. High temperature decreased the maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm), the conformation term for primary photochemistry (Fv/Fo) and performance index (PI), as well as increased minimal fluorescence (Fo). However, at elevated CO2 of 1000~μmol~mol−1 and with a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 800~μmol~m−2~s−1, net photosynthesis (Pn) reached its maximum at 35~°C. The thermal index (IG), calculated from the leaf temperature and the temperature of a dry and wet reference leaf, showed a strong correlation with gs. We conclude that 1) chlorophyll a fluorescence and a combination of fluorescence parameters can be used as early stress indicators as well as to detect the temperature limit of PSII damage, and 2) the strong relation between gs and IG enables gs to be estimated non-invasively, which is an important first step in modelling leaf temperature to predict unfavourable growing conditions in a (dynamic) semi closed greenhouse.},

  abstract = {To achieve the food and energy security of an increasing World population likely to exceed nine billion by 2050 represents a major challenge for plant breeding. Our ability to measure traits under field conditions has improved little over the last decades and currently constitutes a major bottleneck in crop improvement. This work describes the development of a tractor-pulled multi-sensor phenotyping platform for small grain cereals with a focus on the technological development of the system. Various optical sensors like light curtain imaging, 3D Time-of-Flight cameras, laser distance sensors, hyperspectral imaging as well as color imaging are integrated into the system to collect spectral and morphological information of the plants. The study specifies: the mechanical design, the system architecture for data collection and data processing, the phenotyping procedure of the integrated system, results from field trials for data quality evaluation, as well as calibration results for plant height determination as a quantified example for a platform application. Repeated measurements were taken at three developmental stages of the plants in the years 2011 and 2012 employing triticale (×Triticosecale Wittmack L.) as a model species. The technical repeatability of measurement results was high for nearly all different types of sensors which confirmed the high suitability of the platform under field conditions. The developed platform constitutes a robust basis for the development and calibration of further sensor and multi-sensor fusion models to measure various agronomic traits like plant moisture content, lodging, tiller density or biomass yield, and thus, represents a major step towards widening the bottleneck of non-destructive phenotyping for crop improvement and plant genetic studies.},

In this study, we measured the canopy height growth of maize (Zea mays), soybean (Glycine max) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) under field conditions by terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). We tested the hypotheses whether such measurements are capable to elucidate (1) differences in architecture that exist between genotypes; (2) genotypic differences between canopy height growth during the season and (3) short-term growth fluctuations (within 24~h), which could e.g. indicate responses to rapidly fluctuating environmental conditions. The canopies were scanned with a commercially available 3D laser scanner and canopy height growth over time was analyzed with a novel and simple approach using spherical targets with fixed positions during the whole season. This way, a high precision of the measurement was obtained allowing for comparison of canopy parameters (e.g. canopy height growth) at subsequent time points.},

Detection of total seedling leaf area was performed via global segmentation of colour images for preset thresholds of the parameters hue, saturation and value. • Dynamic acclimation of relative growth rate towards altered light conditions occurred within 1 d in N. tabacum exposed to high nutrient availability, but not in plants exposed to low nutrient availability. Increased leaf area was correlated with an increase in shoot fresh and dry weight as well as root growth in N. tabacum. Relative growth rate was shown to be a more appropriate parameter than leaf area for detection of dynamic growth acclimation. Clear differences in leaf growth activity were also observed for A. thaliana. • As growth responses are generally most flexible in early developmental stages, the procedure described here is an important step towards standardized protocols for rapid detection of the effects of changes in internal (genetic) and external (environmental) parameters regulating plant growth.},

These approaches both have constraints. Destructive sampling implies low temporal resolution, restraining the study of dry-matter accumulation rates, while RPM measurements are influenced by the canopy structure and limit intra-field variability identification. We present a phenotyping methodology, based on the use of an affordable RGB camera mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), to monitor the spatial and temporal evolution of canopy height and to estimate DMY. Weekly flights were carried out from April to October above a field comprising a diverse set of accessions. To test the capacity of UAV imagery to estimate canopy height, 8 ground control points and 28 artificial height references were placed at different locations. Accurate flights with an RMSE as low as 0.94 cm were achieved. In addition, canopy height was recorded using an RPM and destructive biomass samples were collected. Different models (linear, multiple linear, principal components, partial least squares regression and random forest) were used to predict DMY, and their performance was evaluated. The best estimations were obtained by combining variables including canopy height, vegetation indices and environmental data in a multiple linear regression (R2 = .81). All models built using UAV data obtained a lower RMSE than the one using RPM data. The approach presented is a possibility for breeders to incorporate new information in their selection process.},

  abstract = {With the establishment of advanced technology facilities for high throughput plant phenotyping, the problem of estimating plant biomass of individual plants from their two dimensional images is becoming increasingly important. The approach predominantly cited in literature is to estimate the biomass of a plant as a linear function of the projected shoot area of plants in the images. However, the estimation error from this model, which is solely a function of projected shoot area, is large, prohibiting accurate estimation of the biomass of plants, particularly for the salt-stressed plants. In this paper, we propose a method based on plant specific weight for improving the accuracy of the linear model and reducing the estimation bias (the difference between actual shoot dry weight and the value of the shoot dry weight estimated with a predictive model). For the proposed method in this study, we modeled the plant shoot dry weight as a function of plant area and plant age. The data used for developing our model and comparing the results with the linear model were collected from a completely randomized block design experiment. A total of 320 plants from two bread wheat varieties were grown in a supported hydroponics system in a greenhouse. The plants were exposed to two levels of hydroponic salt treatments (NaCl at 0 and 100 mM) for 6 weeks. Five harvests were carried out. Each time 64 randomly selected plants were imaged and then harvested to measure the shoot fresh weight and shoot dry weight. The results of statistical analysis showed that with our proposed method, most of the observed variance can be explained, and moreover only a small difference between actual and estimated shoot dry weight was obtained. The low estimation bias indicates that our proposed method can be used to estimate biomass of individual plants regardless of what variety the plant is and what salt treatment has been applied. We validated this model on an independent set of barley data. The technique presented in this paper may extend to other plants and types of stresses.},

These evaluations are typically based on visual observations and manual (destructive) measurements. Robust image capture and analysis procedures that allow phenotyping large collections of genotypes in time series during developmental phases represent a clear advantage as they allow non-destructive monitoring of plant growth and performance. A L. perenne germplasm panel including wild accessions, breeding material and commercial varieties has been used to develop a low-cost, high-throughput phenotyping tool for determining plant growth based on images of individual plants during two consecutive growing seasons. Further we have determined the correlation between image analysis-based estimates of the plant’s base area and the capacity to regrow after cutting, with manual counts of tiller number and measurements of leaf growth 2~weeks after cutting, respectively. When working with field-grown plants, image acquisition and image segmentation are particularly challenging as outdoor light conditions vary throughout the day and the season, and variable soil colours hamper the delineation of the object of interest in the image. Therefore we have used several segmentation methods including colour-, texture- and edge-based approaches, and factors derived after a fast Fourier transformation. The performance of the procedure developed has been analysed in terms of effectiveness across different environmental conditions and time points in the season.},

In this study, we demonstrate the use of image based high-throughput plant phenotyping (HTPP, LemnaTec 3D Scanalyzer, Germany), with Red, Green, Blue (RGB), and hyperspectral cameras, to quantify Quercus bicolor and Quercus prinoides seedlings growth and development [plant height, projected leaf area (LA), plant/canopy width, ConvexHull, and plant aspect ratio], and assess their response to a dry-down period, under controlled environment. HTPP images were validated against low throughput measurements, including gas exchange, leaf spectral properties, and morphological traits. Using HTPP, we recorded significant differences in growth dynamic in examined species, with faster initial growth rate early in the growing season, higher photosynthetic rates, larger LA, and seedling dimension, in Q. bicolor, compared to Q. prinoides. This has ecological implications on species responses to shading and timing of drought stress, as well as their competitive relationship with each other and with other species under changing climate. HTTP showed that both growth and leaf expansion ceased under dry-down treatment. Image derived and measured morphological traits were highly and significantly correlated under both well-watered and dry-down conditions for both species. To obtain meaningful physiological information using spectrometry, we calculated 12 vegetation indices (VIs) from both HTPP and handheld spectrometers. Vogelmann and Maccioni indices had the highest correlations across methods, suggesting their potential use for assessing oak seedlings performance and health. Our results emphasized the importance of VIs ground truthing, since VIs performance can vary significantly between species and treatments. HTPP tools can successfully be used to effectively assess forest seedlings of the two Quercus species, important for early plant selection for forest management purposes and tree improvement programs.},

  abstract = {Thermal and chlorophyll fluorescence imaging are powerful tools for the study of spatial and temporal heterogeneity of leaf transpiration and photosynthetic performance. The relative advantages and disadvantages of these techniques are discussed. When combined, they can highlight pre-symptomatic responses not yet apparent in visual spectrum images and provide specific signatures for diagnosis of distinct diseases and abiotic stresses. In addition, their use for diagnosis and for selection for stomatal or photosynthetic mutants, these techniques can be applied for stress tolerance screening. For example, rapid screening for stomatal responses can be achieved by thermal imaging, while, combined with fluorescence imaging to study photosynthesis, they can potentially be used to derive leaf water use efficiency as a screening parameter. A particular advantage of imaging is that it allows continuous automated monitoring of dynamic spatial variation. Examples of applications include the study of growth and development of plant lines differing in stress resistance, yield, circadian clock-controlled responses, and the possible interactions between these parameters. In the future, such dual-imaging systems could be extended with complementary techniques such as hyperspectral and blue-green fluorescence imaging. This would result in an increased number of quantified parameters which will increase the power of stress diagnosis and the potential for screening of stress-tolerant genotypes.},

  abstract = {The use of chlorophyll fluorescence to monitor photosynthetic performance in algae and plants is now widespread. This review examines how fluorescence parameters can be used to evaluate changes in photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry, linear electron flux, and CO2 assimilation in vivo, and outlines the theoretical bases for the use of specific fluorescence parameters. Although fluorescence parameters can be measured easily, many potential problems may arise when they are applied to predict changes in photosynthetic performance. In particular, consideration is given to problems associated with accurate estimation of the PSII operating efficiency measured by fluorescence and its relationship with the rates of linear electron flux and CO2 assimilation. The roles of photochemical and nonphotochemical quenching in the determination of changes in PSII operating efficiency are examined. Finally, applications of fluorescence imaging to studies of photosynthetic heterogeneity and the rapid screening of large numbers of plants for perturbations in photosynthesis and associated metabolism are considered.},

  abstract = {Plants produced at high relative air humidity (RH) show poor control of water loss after transferring to low RH, a phenomenon which is thought to be due to their stomatal behaviour. The stomatal anatomy and responses of moderate (55\%) and high (90\%) RH grown Tradescantia virginiana plants to treatments that normally induce stomatal closure, i.e. desiccation, abscisic acid (ABA) application and exposure to darkness were studied using attached or detached young, fully expanded leaves. Compared with plants grown at moderate RH the transpiration rate, stomatal conductance and aperture of high RH grown plants measured at the same condition (40\% RH) were, respectively, 112, 139 and 132\% in light and 141, 188 and 370\% in darkness. Besides the differences in stomatal size (guard cell length was 56.7 and 73.3 µm for moderate and high RH grown plants, respectively), there was a clear difference in stomatal behaviour. The stomata responded to desiccation, ABA and darkness in both moderate and high RH grown plants, but the high variability of stomatal closure in high RH grown plants was striking. Some stomata developed at high RH closed in response to darkness or to a decrease in relative water content to the same extent as did stomata from moderate RH grown plants, whereas others closed only partly or did not close at all. Evidently, some as yet unidentified physiological or anatomical changes during development disrupt the normal functioning of some stomata in leaves grown at high RH. The failure of some stomata to close fully in response to ABA suggests that ABA deficiency was not responsible for the lack of stomatal closure in response to desiccation.},

  abstract = {Industrial chicory, Cichorium intybus L., is cultivated for the production of inulin. Most varieties of industrial chicory exhibit rather poor early growth, which limits further yield improvements in their European cultivation area. The poor early growth could be due to suboptimum adaptation of the gene pool to growth at low temperatures, sometimes in combination with high light intensities, which is typical of early-spring mornings. We have used chlorophyll (Chl) a fluorescence to evaluate the response of young plants of the cultivar ‘Hera’ to low temperatures and high light intensities. Plants were grown at three temperatures: 16°C (reference), 8°C (intermediate), and 4°C (cold stress). Lightresponse measurements were carried out at different light intensities in combination with different measurement temperatures. Parameters that quantify the photosystem II (PSII) operating efficiency (including PSII maximum efficiency and PSII efficiency factor) and nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) are important to evaluate the stress in terms of severity, the photosynthetics processes affected, and acclimation to lower growth temperatures. The results clearly demonstrate that in young industrial chicory plants the photosynthetic system adapts to lower growth temperatures. However, to fully understand the plant response to the stresses studied and to evaluate the long-term effect of the stress applied on the growth dynamics, the subsequent dark relaxation dynamics should also be investigated.},

The steady-state and maximal rates of electron transport under a transient high CO2 concentration were monitored using chlorophyll fluorescence imaging. The decrease in electron transport rate induced by dehydration and ABA treatment almost reverted to the control rate under transient high CO2 availability. Therefore, inhibition of photosynthesis was mainly mediated through stomatal closure. However, since reversion was not complete, a metabolic inhibition was also identified as a decrease in the maximal electron transport rate driven by carboxylation. Under dehydration or ABA feeding, as under low ambient CO2 treatment, in 21\% or 0.4\% O2, the lower the steady-state electron transport was, the lower was the maximal electron transport rate during transient high CO2 availability. We conclude that low CO2 availability reduced the capacity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco) to drive electron transport. The potential contribution of Rubisco deactivation mediated by stomatal closure is discussed.},

While the regulation of defence responses has been intensively studied for decades, less is known about the effects of pathogen infection on primary metabolism. Recently, interest in this research area has been growing, and aspects of photosynthesis, assimilate partitioning, and source–sink regulation in different types of plant–pathogen interactions have been investigated. Similarly, phytopathological studies take into consideration the physiological status of the infected tissues to elucidate the fine-tuned infection mechanisms. The aim of this review is to give a summary of recent advances in the mutual interrelation between primary metabolism and pathogen infection, as well as to indicate current developments in non-invasive techniques and important strategies of combining modern molecular and physiological techniques with phytopathology for future investigations.},

  abstract = {A time-resolved study of the effects of heat stress (23 to 50°C) on Fo level of chlorophyll fluorescence of leaves having different antenna content has been performed in order to elucidate the causes of heat induced increase of Foin vivo. The multi-exponential deconvolution of the decays after a picosecond flash at Fo have shown that the best fit in both wild-type and the mutant chlorina F2 of barley leaves is obtained with three components in the temperature range utilized (100, 400 and 1200 ps at 23°C). In intermittent light greened pea leaves, a fourth long lifetime component (4 ns at 23°C) is needed. The comparison of the three types of leaves at 23°C shows that the content of the LHCII b complex does not affect the lifetimes of the two main components (100 and 400 ps) and affects their preexponential factors. This result suggests that in the PS II unit the exciton transfer from LHC IIb to the rest of the antenna is irreversible. The effects of heat stress on individual lifetime components, Ti, included several changes. Utilizing for PS II unit an extended ‘Reversible Radical Pair’ model, having three compartments, to interpret the variations of Ti and Ai induced by temperature increases, it can be inferred that heat determines: (i) an irreversible disconnection of a monor antenna complex which is not the LHC IIb complex, this effect is induced by temperatures higher than 40°C; (ii) a decrease of the quantum efficiency of Photosystem II photochemistry which is due to several effects: a decrease of the rate of charge separation, an increase of P+I- recombination rate constant and a decrease of the stabilization of charges. These effects on Photosystem II photochemistry start to occur above 30°C and are partially reversible.},

  abstract = {Salinity is a widespread soil problem limiting productivity of cereal crops worldwide. Rice is particularly sensitive to salt stress during the seedling stage, with consequent poor crop establishment, as well as during reproduction where salinity can severely disrupt grain formation and yield. Tolerance at the seedling stage is weakly associated with tolerance during reproduction. Physiological responses to salinity were evaluated for contrasting genotypes, during the seedling and reproductive stages.Three rice genotypes differing in their tolerance of salinity were evaluated in a set of greenhouse experiments under salt stress during both seedling stage and reproduction.Photosynthetic CO2 fixation, stomatal conductance (gs) and transpiration decreased substantially because of salt stress, but with greater reduction in the sensitive cultivar IR29. The tolerant lines IR651 and IR632 had more responsive stomata that tended to close faster during the first few hours of stress, followed by partial recovery after a brief period of acclimation. However, in the sensitive line, gs continued to decrease for longer duration and with no recovery afterward. Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements revealed that non-photochemical quenching increased, whereas the electron transport rate decreased under salt stress. Salt-tolerant cultivars exhibited much lower lipid peroxidation, maintained elevated levels of reduced ascorbic acid and showed increased activities of the enzymes involved in the reactive oxygen scavenging system during both developmental stages.Upregulation of the anti-oxidant system appears to play a role in salt tolerance of rice, with tolerant genotypes also maintaining relatively higher photosynthetic function; during both the vegetative and reproductive stages.},

Under N-stress the decline in photosynthesis and the rise in stomatal conductance determined at light saturation level were accompanied by an increase of the intercellular CO2 concentration (about +60\%). This indicates that the decline in Amax (photosynthetic activity at light saturation level) was due to limitation related to a reduced mesophyllic activity, rather than to stomatal limitation. At low light intensity photosynthetic efficiency of PSII was not affected. In N-stressed plants starch content decreased significantly in leaves. The sucrose/starch ratio rose in N-stressed plants, indicating that the carbon partitioning trend had shifted towards sucrose. This result is in accordance with the lower shoot/root ratio observed in nitrogen-stressed plants.},

Requirements are identified for more extensive intercomparisons of different approaches and for further work on the strategies for interpreting canopy scale data. The paper examines the prospects for extending research to the wider range of pigments in addition to chlorophyll, testing emerging methods of hyperspectral analysis and exploring the fusion of hyperspectral and LIDAR remote sensing. In spite of these opportunities for further development and the refinement of techniques, current evidence of an expanding range of applications in the ecophysiological, environmental, agricultural, and forestry sciences highlights the growing value of hyperspectral remote sensing of plant pigments.},

The following points are made: i) Fractional vegetation cover and LAI are not entirely independent quantities, depending on how LAI is defined. Care must be taken in using LAI and fractional vegetation cover independently in a model because the former may partially take account of the latter; ii) A scaled NDVI taken between the limits of minimum (bare soil) and miximum fractional vegetation cover is insenstive to atmospheric correction for both clear and hazy conditions, at least for viewing angles less than about 20 degrees from nadir; iii) A simple relation between scaled NDVI and fractional vegetation cover, previously described in the literature, is further confirmed by the .simulations; iv) The sensitive dependence of LAI on NDVI when the former is below a value of about 2–4 may be viewed as being due to the variation in the bare soil component.},

  abstract = {We explored simple and useful spectral indices for estimating photosynthetic variables (radiation use efficiency and photosynthetic capacity) at a canopy scale based on seasonal measurements of hyperspectral reflectance, ecosystem CO2 flux, and plant and micrometeorological variables. An experimental study was conducted over the simple and homogenous ecosystem of an irrigated rice field. Photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy (APAR), the canopy absorptivity of APAR (fAPAR), net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEECO2) gross primary productivity (GPP), photosynthetic capacity at the saturating APAR (Pmax), and three parameters of radiation use efficiency (εN: NEECO2/APAR; εG: GPP/APAR; φ: quantum efficiency) were derived from the data set. Based on the statistical analysis of relationships between these ecophysiological variables and reflectance indicators such as normalized difference spectral indices (NDSI[i,j]) using all combinations of two wavelengths (i and j nm), we found several new indices that would were more effective than conventional spectral indices such as photochemical reflectance index (PRI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI=NDSI[near-infrared, red]). εG was correlated well with NDSI[710, 410], NDSI[710, 520], and NDSI[530, 550] derived from nadir measurements. φ was best correlated with NDSI[450, 1330]. NDSI[550, 410] and NDSI[720, 420] had a consistent linear relationships with fAPAR throughout the growing season, whereas conventional indices such as NDVI showed very different relationships before and after heading. Off-nadir measurements were more closely related to the efficiency parameters than nadir measurements. Our results provide useful insights for assessing plant productivity and ecosystem CO2 exchange, using a wide range of available spectral data as well as useful information for designing future sensors for ecosystem observations.},

Visual assessment was made at four levels, namely, at the head, at the flag leaves, at 2nd and 3rd leaves, and at the lower canopy. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) analyses were implemented separately on data captured at four growing stages to establish separate calibration models to predict the percentage coverage of yellow rust and fusarium head blight infection. Results showed that the standard deviation between 500 and 650~nm and the squared difference between 650 and 700~nm wavelengths were found to be significantly different between healthy and infected canopy particularly for yellow rust in both crops, whereas the effect of water-stress was generally found to be unimportant. The PLSR yellow rust models were of good prediction capability for 6 out of 8 growing stages, a very good prediction at early milk stage in wheat and a moderate prediction at the late milk development stage in barley. For fusarium, predictions were very good for seven growing stages and of good performance for anthesis growing stage in wheat, with best performing for the milk development stages. However, the root mean square error of predictions for yellow rust were almost half of those for fusarium, suggesting higher prediction accuracies for yellow rust measurement under laboratory conditions.},

Elucidation of the genetic basis of components contributing to drought tolerance is likely to be more tractable than that of overall drought tolerance. Certain of the traits which contribute to drought tolerance in plants and the high-throughput phenotyping techniques available to measure those traits are described in this paper. On the basis of the dynamic nature of drought, plant development, and the resulting stress response, the focus is on non-destructive imaging techniques which allow a temporal resolution and monitoring of the same plants throughout the experiment.

  abstract = {Reliable, precise and accurate estimates of disease severity are important for predicting yield loss, monitoring and forecasting epidemics, for assessing crop germplasm for disease resistance, and for understanding fundamental biological processes including co-evolution. Disease assessments that are inaccurate and/or imprecise might lead to faulty conclusions being drawn from the data, which in turn can lead to incorrect actions being taken in disease management decisions. Plant disease can be quantified in several different ways. This review considers plant disease severity assessment at the scale of individual plant parts or plants, and describes our current understanding of the sources and causes of assessment error, a better understanding of which is required before improvements can be targeted. The review also considers how these can be identified using various statistical tools. Indeed, great strides have been made in the last thirty years in identifying the sources of assessment error inherent to visual rating, and this review highlights ways that assessment errors can be reduced—particularly by training raters or using assessment aids. Lesion number in relation to area infected is known to influence accuracy and precision of visual estimates—the greater the number of lesions for a given area infected results in more overestimation. Furthermore, there is a widespread tendency to overestimate disease severity at low severities ({$<$}10\%). Both interrater and intrarater reliability can be variable, particularly if training or rating aids are not used. During the last eighty years acceptable accuracy and precision of visual disease assessments have often been achieved using disease scales, particularly because of the time they allegedly save, and the ease with which they can be learned, but recent work suggests there can be some disadvantages to their use. This review considers new technologies that offer opportunity to assess disease with greater objectivity (reliability, precision, and accuracy). One of these, visible light photography and digital image analysis has been increasingly used over the last thirty years, as software has become more sophisticated and user-friendly. Indeed, some studies have produced very accurate estimates of disease using image analysis. In contrast, hyperspectral imagery is relatively recent and has not been widely applied in plant pathology. Nonetheless, it offers interesting and potentially discerning opportunities to assess disease. As plant disease assessment becomes better understood, it is against the backdrop of concepts of reliability, precision and accuracy (and agreement) in plant pathology and measurement science. This review briefly describes these concepts in relation to plant disease assessment. Various advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches to disease assessment are described. For each assessment method some future research priorities are identified that would be of value in better understanding the theory of disease assessment, as it applies to improving and fully realizing the potential of image analysis and hyperspectral imagery.},

  abstract = {Automatic detection of early blight caused by Alternaria solani could promote a drastic reduction in the consumption of plant protection agents and the related production losses. A proximal sensing platform was constructed and calibrated for acquiring high resolution hyperspectral images in the field, and used to accurately map Alternaria lesions. High resolution canopy reflectance images were obtained for 32 potato plants that had been infected with A. solani and 32 healthy reference plants. Spectral classifiers like partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and support vector machines (SVM) based on PCA scores were tested to discriminate affected and non-affected pixels. Both spectral classifiers performed well at pixel level with accuracies above 0.92. The NIR region (750~nm) was identified as the most discriminative part of the spectrum for detecting the lesions. As the disease pressure is typically expressed as the number of lesions per area, the accuracy was also evaluated at this level. This indicated a considerable number of false detections at the edges of the leaves and the leaf axils. Therefore, a decision tree was designed based on expert knowledge about the shape of Alternaria lesions, and used to post-process the classified images. This reduced the number of false detections, increasing the precision from 0.17 to 0.22 at the expense of a reduction in recall from 0.88 to 0.84. This leaves considerable room for improvement in the classification accuracy at the object level. We learned that (1) few, broad wavelengths are sufficient and (2) spatial context is essential for the detection of lesions caused by Alternaria infection. The application of more powerful object classification techniques such as convolutional neural networks to enhance the model performance by efficiently encapsulating the spatial context in the classifier might further improve the detection performance. This could pave the way to UAV or tractor based Alternaria mapping.},

Sorghum (cv. DK 44C) was seeded in 360 twelve-litre pots filled with fine sand. All pots were irrigated with half-strength Hoagland's nutrient solution from emergence to 25 days after sowing (DAS). Thereafter, pots were separated into three identical groups and the following treatments were initiated: (1) the control (100\% N) continued receiving the half-strength nutrient solution; (2) reduced N to 20\% of the control (20\% N); and (3) withheld N from the solution (0\% N). Photosynthetic rate (Pn), chlorophyll (Chl) and N concentrations, and hyperspectral reflectance of the uppermost, fully expanded leaves were determined at 3- to 4-day-interval from 21 to 58 DAS during the N treatments. Plants were harvested 58 DAS to determine effects of N deficiency on leaf area (LA), biomass accumulation, and partitioning. Nitrogen deficiency significantly reduced LA, leaf Chl content and Pn, resulting in lower biomass production. Decreased leaf Pn due to N deficiency was mainly associated with lower stomatal conductance rather than carboxylation capacity of leaf chemistry. Among plant components of dry weights, leaf dry weight had the greatest and root dry weight had the smallest decrease under N deficiency. Nitrogen-deficit stress mainly increased leaf reflectance at 555 (R555) and 715nm (R715) and caused a red-edge shift to shorter wavelength. Leaf N and Chl concentrations were linearly correlated with not only the reflectance ratios of R405/R715 (r2 = 0.68***) and R1075/R735 (r2 = 0.64***), respectively, but also the first derivatives of the reflectance (dR/dλ) in red edge centered 730 or 740nm (r2 = 0.73–0.82***). These specific reflectance ratios or dR/dλ may be used for rapid and non-destructive estimation of sorghum leaf Chl and plant N status.},

  abstract = {A new weighing lysimeter system is described measuring transpiration and water uptake simultaneously on one plant, growing in water culture. The measurements may be made for short time intervals (min) making it possible to monitor quick responses to changing environmental conditions. Fresh weight change, a combination of growth and water status alterations in the plant, may be calculated from transpiration and water uptake. The system consists of two communicating vessels filled with nutrient solution; each placed on an electronic balance. One of these vessels carries the plant and is connected to the other by a flexible tube. Water uptake will cause an equal decrease of the solution level in each vessel. The weight decrease of the vessel with no plant provides a measure of water uptake, the total weight decrease on both balances represents transpiration.Test observations showed that measurements of transpiration and water uptake in a greenhouse can be made to an accuracy of about 0.03 g min−1 plant−1. With fluctuating radiation, a clearly radiation-dependent transpiration was measured on a tomato plant in a greenhouse. These measurements showed a delay between transpiration and water uptake. Consequently, fresh weight also fluctuated with radiation. An immediate decrease in transpiration was measured upon closure of a screen in the greenhouse, accompanied by an increase in fresh weight. From late afternoon until sunrise a constant fresh weight increase was measured; first at a relatively high rate probably due to growth and recovering from water deficits, thereafter at a constant rate probably only due to growth.},

  abstract = {Reduced blue light irradiance is known to enhance leaf elongation rate (LER) in grasses, but the mechanisms involved have not yet been elucidated. We investigated whether leaf elongation response to reduced blue light could be mediated by stomata-induced variations of plant transpiration. Two experiments were carried out on tall fescue in order to monitor LER and transpiration under reduced blue light irradiance. Additionally, LER dynamics were compared with those observed in the response to vapour pressure deficit (VPD)-induced variations of transpiration. Finally, we developed a model of water flow within a tiller to simulate the observed short-term response of LER to various transpiration regimes. LER dramatically increased in response to blue light reduction and then reached new steady states, which remained higher than the control. Reduced blue light triggered a simultaneous stomatal closure which induced an immediate decrease of leaf transpiration. The hydraulic model of leaf elongation accurately predicted the LER response to blue light and VPD, resulting from an increase in the growth-induced water potential gradient in the leaf growth zone. Our results suggest that the blue light signal is sensed by stomata of expanded leaves and transduced to the leaf growth zone through the hydraulic architecture of the tiller.},

This radial transport results from the water potential difference between these tissues, which is influenced by both hydraulic and carbon related processes. Measurements have shown that when subjected to the same environmental conditions, the co-occurring mangrove species Avicennia marina and Rhizophora stylosa unexpectedly show a totally different pattern in daily stem diameter variation.Using in situ measurements of stem diameter variation, stem water potential and sap flow, a mechanistic flow and storage model based on the cohesion–tension theory was applied to assess the differences in osmotic storage water potential between Avicennia marina and Rhizophora stylosa.Both species, subjected to the same environmental conditions, showed a resembling daily pattern in simulated osmotic storage water potential. However, the osmotic storage water potential of R. stylosa started to decrease slightly after that of A. marina in the morning and increased again slightly later in the evening. This small shift in osmotic storage water potential likely underlaid the marked differences in daily stem diameter variation pattern between the two species.The results show that in addition to environmental dynamics, endogenous changes in the osmotic storage water potential must be taken into account in order to accurately predict stem diameter variations, and hence growth.},

Given the strong influence of gs on bulk leaf water potential and turgor pressure (P), in vivo measurement of P may provide useful information about diurnal or seasonal dynamics of gs. Moderate plant water stress affects the diurnal dynamics of P as leaf-to-air vapour pressure deficit (D) varies, and these dynamics correlate to gs. Here, we explored relative changes in P in response to changes in D under mild drought conditions, and how these changes are linked to stomatal behaviour, and specifically to diurnal maximum gs (gs,max), one of the best indicators of plant water stress. We monitored ecophysiological and environmental variables, as well as a relative proxy for P, during three consecutive seasons in a hedgerow olive orchard where trees were supplied with different irrigation treatments to create well-watered and moderately water-stressed conditions. Our results demonstrated that the sensitivity of P to D correlated well with gs,max reached by the trees within a range in which variations in gs are the main diffusional limitation to photosynthesis. We further showed that this correlation held under a wide range of meteorological conditions and soil water availability. This turgor proxy measurement, which is much easier to measure than gs, can facilitate the use of gs,max as an indicator of plant water stress and evapotranspiration in agriculture and plant science research.},

  abstract = {Thorough knowledge of root system functioning is essential to understand the feedback loops between plants, soil, and climate. In situ characterization of root systems is challenging due to the inaccessibility of roots and the complexity of root zone processes. Electrical methods have been proposed to overcome these difficulties. Electrical conduction and polarization occur in and around roots, but the mechanisms are not yet fully understood. We review the potential and limitations of low-frequency electrical techniques for root zone investigation, discuss the mechanisms behind electrical conduction and polarization in the soil–root continuum, and address knowledge gaps. A range of electrical methods for root investigation is available. Reported methods using current injection in the plant stem to assess the extension of the root system lack robustness. Multi-electrode measurements are increasingly used to quantify root zone processes through soil moisture changes. They often neglect the influence of root biomass on the electrical signal, probably because it is yet to be well understood. Recent research highlights the potential of frequency-dependent impedance measurements. These methods target both surface and volumetric properties by activating and quantifying polarization mechanisms occurring at the root segment and cell scale at specific frequencies. The spectroscopic approach opens up a range of applications. Nevertheless, understanding electrical signatures at the field scale requires significant understanding of small-scale polarization and conduction mechanisms. Improved mechanistic soil–root electrical models, validated with small-scale electrical measurements on root systems, are necessary to make further progress in ramping up the precision and accuracy of multi-electrode tomographic techniques for root zone investigation.},

So far, little research has been performed on quantifying the effect of light intensity on the different contributors to the fruit water balance. However, as light intensity affects both transpiration and photosynthesis, it might be expected to induce important changes in the fruit water balance. In this study, tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L.) were grown in light and shade conditions and the fruit water balance was studied by measuring fruit growth of girdled and intact fruits with linear variable displacement transducers combined with a model-based approach. Results indicated that the relative xylem contribution significantly increased when shading lowered light intensity. This resulted from both a higher xylem influx and a lower phloem influx during the daytime. Plants from the shade treatment were able to maintain a stronger gradient in total water potential between stem and fruits during daytime, thereby promoting xylem influx. It appeared that the xylem pathway was still functional at 35 days after anthesis and that relative xylem contribution was strongly affected by environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {Although growers seem to be able to control the incidence of tipburn in soilgrown lettuce (Lactuca spp.), this physiological disorder causes substantial yield losses in hydroponics (up to 50\%). Tipburn is generally considered to be a calcium deficiency related disorder, but literature exhibits apparently contradictory findings, because the research always focused on the effects of the environment on the occurrence of tipburn, whereas the plant physiological aspects were seldom included. Therefore, there is a strong need for a plant physiological interpretation of the tipburn disorder, which correlates the different environmental effects to the plant physiological processes.  In this study, we present the use of plant sensors to assess the plant physiological response to its environment with respect to the incidence of tipburn. As such, stem diameter and leaf thickness were continuously monitored, because variations in these variables are strongly related to variations in the plant water relations, turgor pressure and growth rate. Leaf thickness measurements were combined with a mechanistic model to detect periods of water deficits or abrupt changes in turgor pressure. This approach could additionally help to monitor root pressure and investigate the hypothesis that root pressure has beneficial effects on the supply of calcium to slowly transpiring leaves. As such, growth rate, supply of calcium to low transpiring leaves and abrupt variations in turgor pressure, all of which are associated with tipburn, could be instantly visualised by these plant sensors and consequently identify environmental drivers for tipburn.},
