This chapter looks at current developments in the field of \textit{in silico} plants, intending to design \acrshort{rc} experiments with simulated organisms.
Research with \textit{in vivo} plants is difficult and time-consuming as it involves meticulous experimental design, long observation times, and of course keeping the plants healthy during the experiment\citep{pieters_plants_2021}.
For these reasons, it is of great interest to explore computer simulations of plants that can accelerate research in reservoir computing applications.
