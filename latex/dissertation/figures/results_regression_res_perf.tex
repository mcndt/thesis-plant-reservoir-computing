	         The different plots show the prediction accuracy (y axis) for a suite of regression tasks (x axis) for each of the physiological reservoirs from \mbox{Table \ref{table:simulation_reservoirs}}.
	         The regression target of net photosynthesis rate  $A_n$ was only available for the HydroShoot model.
	         Each boxplot shows the distribution of test across 16 random reservoir samplings.
	         The box shows the quartiles of the distribution; the whiskers indicate the 5th and 95th percentiles.
	         Outliers are shown as a diamond shape.}
