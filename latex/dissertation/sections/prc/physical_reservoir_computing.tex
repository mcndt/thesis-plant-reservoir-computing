% What is physical reservoir computing?
The RC model easily extends to the physical world by interpreting physical systems that exhibit nonlinear dynamics and memory effects as a reservoir substrate  \citep{nakajima_physical_2020}. 
In other words, this Physical Reservoir Computing (PRC) framework aims to exploit dynamics found in the natural world to perform computational tasks. 
% How is RC transferred to the real world?
\mbox{Figure \ref{fig:prc_examples}} shows a mapping of the RNN-based RC architecture to two physical applications from the literature and the plant RC case discussed in this thesis.
In the physical systems (\mbox{Figures \ref{fig:prc_examples}}b, c, and d), it is impossible to observe the complete state of the reservoir as in the RNN-based reservoir. 
Instead, the reservoir state is inferred from sensor data observing the dynamical system in real-time \citep{burms_reward-modulated_2015, nakajima_information_2015}.

% What applications have been made with PRC?
PRC is a field of interdisciplinary research, implementing reservoirs using a large variety of materials \citep{tanaka_recent_2019}.
Examples of substrates being researched are analog electrical circuits \citep{soriano_minimal_2015, zhao_novel_2016}, FPGAs \citep{antonik_application_2018}, memristive circuits \citep{walter_neuromorphic_2015}, photonic circuits \citep{van_der_sande_advances_2017}, spintronics \citep{torrejon_neuromorphic_2017}, and soft body robotics \citep{caluwaerts_body_2011, caluwaerts_design_2014, nakajima_soft_2013}.
Biological reservoirs are closely investigated as well, with a particular interest in neurobiology \citep{hafizovic_cmos-based_2007, hinaut_real-time_2013} and ecological dynamics \citep{jones_is_2007, didovyk_distributed_2015,ushio_computational_2021}. 
Most recently, \citet{pieters_plants_2021} demonstrated promising results in the use of \textit{in vivo} plants as reservoir substrate.


% What is the goal of PRC research?
A common misconception about PRC research is that the goal is to achieve general-purpose computation with unconventional reservoirs. 
However, the aim is not to outperform silicon computers at carrying out generic calculations. 
Instead, in most cases, the goal is to bypass the need for precise modeling of a physical system by observing how the system responds to inputs rather than attempting to predict how the inputs influence the state of the system \citep{nakajima_physical_2020}.
This method is particularly applicable in real-time control scenarios such as robotics, where real-time integration of sensor data is more feasible than power-hungry physics simulations (see e.g.\ \cite{caluwaerts_design_2014, burms_reward-modulated_2015}), 
or for the prediction of chaotic systems where powerful computers are not able to predict the system better than low-powered reservoir models \citep{gauthier_next_2021}.
